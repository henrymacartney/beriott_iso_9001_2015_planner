# User Requirements Specification for ISO 9001:2015 Planning Application (Version 01)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the user requirements for the ISO 9001:2015 Planning Application (Version 01), a web-based tool designed<br>
to replace the existing Excel-based system for planning and tracking ISO 9001:2015 implementation. The application provides a structured<br>
approach to managing the ISO 9001:2015 implementation process across multiple phases and tasks.
The Excel sheet formally used for an ISO implementation is shown below.

## 2. Application Overview

The ISO 9001:2015 Planning Application is a browser-based tool that allows users to:
- Track the progress of ISO 9001:2015 implementation across 7 phases
- Manage individual tasks within each phase
- Record document references, start dates, and target dates for each task
- Track task status and completion percentages
- Assign responsibilities for task execution
- Plan activities across a 12-week timeline
- Save and load implementation plans

## 3. User Interface Requirements

### 3.1 General Layout

The application shall have the following layout components:
- The layout of the application is to be styled with Tailwind
- A header with the title "ISO 9001 Implementation Plan"
- A software version number with the actual version of the app e.g. for the first version '(vers. 01)'
- The version number is to appear on the same line as the title and with font-size of 16px
- A colour key indicating PLAN (#d9f2d9), EXECUTION (#d9e6f2), REVIEW (#f2d9da) and ONGOING (#f2e6d9)
- A control panel with buttons for adding tasks [green (#45a049) with white text], deleting tasks [red (#ff0000) with white text], saving plans [green with white text], 
clearing current plan [red with white text], and loading plans [green with white text]
- A horizontal line with column headings: TaskID | Task Name | Document Reference | Start Date | Target Date | % Complete | Status | Action/Who | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 |
  - This line has a blue (#d9e6f2) background and slate-grey (#334155) text
  - Immediately below the individual weeks are the dates for that week - see Week 1, which has the working days of that week 13.-17.01
  - On opening the app only the first four weeks of the project are displayed.
  - The 'Task Name' and 'Document Reference' fields must be long enough to hold the following example text 'Task ID 7 | ISO 9001 Implementation Plan (this document)' without word wrap
- A main table area displaying the implementation plan

Figure 2 - Heading titles

### 3.2 Control Panel

The control panel shall include the following buttons:
- On starting the app no previous plan is loaded; to load a plan the user must choose 'Load Plan'
- Add Task: Allows users to add new tasks to the implementation plan
- Delete Task: Allows users to delete a task in the implement plan; none of the tasks loaded at start of app may be deleted, therefore 'Delete Task' button is greyed out until a new task is created.
- Newly created tasks by the user may be deleted, i.e. 'Delete Task' button is active
- If only one newly created user task exists and it is deleted 'Delete Task' button is greyed out again.
- Save Plan: Saves the current implementation plan to local storage
- Load Plan: Loads a previously saved implementation plan from local storage; no previously saved implementation plan is loaded on starting the app

### 3.3 Implementation Plan Table

The implementation plan table shall include the following columns:
- Task ID (split into Phase and Task Number)
